Contributions included everything in each weeks feedback.
  * Obtained tool licenses (this seriously sucked and took some time).
  * Installed and ran/managed tools in IntelliJ and directly in Github to generate tool results.
  * Did research for the tools and other resources used.
  * Analyzed all of the PVS-Studio Results
  * Analyzed some of the Kritika Results (mostly to weed them out and help decide which ones we didn't want to focus on).
  * Wrote a large portion of the first few drafts of the paper.
  * Worked on the final poster with Brian
